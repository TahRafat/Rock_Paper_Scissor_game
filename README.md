 🪨📃✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – Flask Web Game

This is a simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **HTML + JavaScript** for the frontend.

 🎮 How It Works

- Users can play by clicking rock 🪨, paper 📃, or scissors ✂️.
- The game sends the user's choice to the Flask server.
- Flask randomly chooses a move for the computer.
- The result (win, lose, or tie) is sent back and displayed on the web page.
